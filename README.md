# Goal
The exercise consists of building an application to view Spacex’s latest launches, and
being able to add them to a “favourite” list to revisit them later.
The application should be developed using React(16.8.4)/Angular/Vue

This is a list of functionality the candidate needs to include in the app order by priority,
there’s no need to do everything, let’s include as much as you can:
1. Fetch endpoints and merge arrays (we need to populate the rocket data of the
launches with the rockets array)
2. Display launches
3. Favorite functionality (persist them on local storage)
4. Search by mission name
5. Inspect a specific launch detail
6. Pagination

## Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/Ojes/ch-spacex.git`

2. `cd ch-spacex`

3. `npm install`

4. `npm run dev`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
